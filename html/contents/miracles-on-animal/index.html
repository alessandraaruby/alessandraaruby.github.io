<h4>Mosquito</h4>

<p>"Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, 'What did Allah intend by this as an example?' He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient." (Quran 2:26)</p>

<h4>Donkey</h4>

<p>"And [He created] the horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride and [as] adornment. And He creates that which you do not know." (Quran 16:8).</p>

<p>Narrated By Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, 'A man who never did any good deed, said that if he died, his family should burn him and throw half the ashes of his burnt body in the earth and the other half in the sea, for by Allah, if Allah should get hold of him, He would inflict such punishment on him as He would not inflict on anybody among the people. But Allah ordered the sea to collect what was in it (of his ashes) and similarly ordered the earth to collect what was in it (of his ashes). Then Allah said (to the recreated man), 'Why did you do so?' The man replied, 'For being afraid of You, and You know it (very well).' So Allah forgave him.' [Sahih Bukhari, Vol 9, Book 93, Hadith 597]</p>

(Tirmidhi Vol. 4, Book 12, Hadith 2541)</p>

<h4>The Bee</h4>

<p>"And your Lord inspired to the bee, 'Take for yourself among the mountains, houses, and among the trees and [in] that which they construct. Then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you].' There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought." (Quran 16:68-69)</p>

Then while in that state, Yunus also glorified Allah ﷻ, which was heard by the angels. They then said, «O our Lord, we heard a very weak voice coming from unusual land.» Allah ﷻ said, «That is My slave Yunus, he disobeyed me, so I detained him inside a whale in the sea.» They said, «Is he the pious slave from whom the good deeds ascended to You everyday and night?» Allah ﷻ replied, «Yes.» So the angels then pleaded on his behalf, so Allah ﷻ ordered the whale to throw him out on the shore.» [Tafseer al-Tabari (18/518), Tafseer Ibn Abi Hatim (10/3227) No. 18278, Musnad al-Bazzar (15/34) No. 8227 and Tafseer Ibn Katheer (5/367)]</p>
